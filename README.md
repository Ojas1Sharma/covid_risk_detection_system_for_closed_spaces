# A REAL-TIME SYSTEM FOR DETECTION AND RECOGNIZING FACE-MASK OFFENDERS
The proposed model will capture real time video from a surveillance system and depending on whether the people are wearing proper masks or not, send them an email,whatsapp msg and a SMS. If the person is not wearing a mask, the frame in which he/she can be seen without mask is recorded and saved in the colab workspace.
mean average precision (mAP) for detecting masks: .92
Accuracy for face match: 96%
